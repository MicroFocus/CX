# CX-App

The CX-App will be an application on top of other IAS products to provide a Unified User Experience

This component accepts contributions and performs releases under an [Inner Source](http://wiki.esecurity.net:8090/display/IS/Inner+Source+Home) model.

### Benefits

Unified Customer Experience overlapping existing IAS Products

### Issue Tracking

As a component governed by an inner source constitution, **the engineering team of the product consuming this component is expected to fix issues** in this component on the timeline they require it.  The product engineering team is welcome to recruit training or coding assistance from the community using this component, including the SC, to help get the issue fixed, however, product team must understand the community or SC may be busy with other things and may not be able to assist on the timeline the product team requires it.  Product teams that rely heavily or critically on this component are encouraged to built expertise in this component's code and nominate a member of their team to be voted into the SC in order to streamline the acceptance of their pull requests.

Customers of products that use this component should file support requests and bugs directly against the product. Each product that uses this component should create a functional sub-area category in its bug tracking system that incorporates this component. The product team is responsible for triaging any newly reported bugs and determining whether the issue resides within the main product, the product's integration of this component, or this component itself. If the latter, then the product engineering team should clone the reported issue to this component's issue tracker and set up a dependency link. We need to have issues filed both under the product and the component for proper tracking.

## Building This Component

The Steering Committee of this component maintains a build server to enable the community to quickly create builds of code submitted to the authoritative repository.  See the "Component Resources" section of this document for links to the build server.

This section explains how to build from source if you wish to perform a build without using the build server.  The steps below assume you've already created a local clone of the repository.
