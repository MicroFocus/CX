# CX-App

The CX-App is a set of examples of how to use the CX methodology to create new UX applications for Micro Focus and NetIQ products.  

There are currently three CX projects:  

*   **self-registration** shows you how to use the [ng-ias](https://github.com/MicroFocus/ng-ias) project to create a wizard for creating new users that matches the Micro Focus look and feel.
*   **self-registration-2** shows you how to create a single page application for registering new users.  This sample uses Bootstrap and Font Awesome to show you how to create a different look and feel with CX.
*   **ig-overview** shows you how to integrate with OAuth2 and OSP to make authenticated REST calls to [Identity Governance] (https://www.netiq.com/products/identity-governance/).

To use CX clone or download the repository.  Each of those projects has a separate README file with instructions.
