## How Meetings Are Run

   * Meetings are hosted by the SC, with one SC member elected/volunteered as chair.
   * The meeting chair will call the meeting to order and drive the agenda. Participants are asked to respect the chair's authority to keep the meeting running smoothly.
   * Decision-making:
      * After suitable discussion on a particular agenda topic, any attendee may move to approve/reject the issue; a second member must second the motion for it to be taken up.
      * The chair will then call for any objections to the motion; if no objections are heard, the motion is approved. Objections will trigger further discussion.
      * If no unanimous consensus is reached, the chair may call for an up/down vote of SC members to reach a decision.
      * For larger decisions that may require further review, the chair may create a ballot for SC members to vote on asynchronously.

Note that meetings may be recorded so that accurate minutes can be maintained.
