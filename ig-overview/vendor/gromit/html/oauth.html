                This page is supposed to show up in an iFrame which then calls to the parent frame to close 
                itself and let you get back to work.  However, the security provider has redirected the parent
                frame instead of the iFrame which subverts this mechanism.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are now logged in, but you will have to manually go back to the application you were using.
