  #### What
  High-level page layout patterns.
  
  #### Types
  * Dashboard View 
    * Used when multiple views into a subarea of the application.  
    * Widgets provide the specific subviews on this page.
  * Data Grid View
    * Used to display large, table-like listings of data.  
    * Can be configurable, with the title-bar area providing a live view of the payload.
  * Detail Master View (with subviews)
    * For a singular object, this page is typically a collection of subviews, shown by tabs.  
    * Global actions are collected up in the global area.
  * Simple Detail View
    * If no subviews are needed, and if there is no parent view, then the tab-bar area goes away.
