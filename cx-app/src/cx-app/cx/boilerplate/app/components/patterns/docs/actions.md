  #### What
  Actions are when the user interacts with the application.  This is often either a request for more information, or is providing information (input/output).
  
  #### Working Examples
    
  #### Types
  * Primary Page-Level Actions
  * Secondary Actions
  * Tertiary Actions
  * Negative Actions
  * Drill-down
  * Decision
  
  #### Implement
  You want to highlight the available actions to the user in a trasnparent manner, without overloading them with too many options.
  
  Actionable items (often buttons) should be color-coded to help associate actionable areas to the user.
  
  Ideally these action-colors (particularly the primary) would be isolated to use just for actions, to help reinforce the idea of the color to the `action` of action.
